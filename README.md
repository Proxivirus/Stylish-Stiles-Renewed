Are you sick and tired of placing carpets on fences? Me too! No longer shall our immersion be torn asunder!

This mod adds new fence blocks (called stiles) that function identically to carpeted fences. Players can jump over stiles, whilst mobs cannot!

Fully integrates with both vanilla AND supported modded fences (mod support listed below).

### Note
This is a fork of the original [Stylish Stiles](https://modrinth.com/mod/stylish-stiles) made by [Chrisdw889](https://modrinth.com/user/Chrisdw889). He has been inactive on Github for over 8 months as of writing this, so I made this fork so that I could use Stylish Stiles in the newer versions of Minecraft. It is 100% compatible with the original mod. If you are transitioning from the old mod to the new mod, all you need to do is delete the old one and download this one. All of your blocks will stay. This mod DOES use some code from the original mod, as is allowed by the MIT license it is under. The original license can be found on the original author's Github page [HERE](https://github.com/Chrisdw889/StylishStiles/blob/1.20.1-forge/LICENSE), as well as on my own Github page [HERE](https://github.com/Proxivirus/Stylish-Stiles-Renewed/blob/main/reused_code_license.txt). All other code reused in my mod was under a CC0 license (found [HERE](https://github.com/Chrisdw889/StylishStiles/blob/1.21-fabric/LICENSE)) and therefore is free for use in the public domain.

On a related note, if the original author ever returns to development, I have every intention of attempting to work with them to merge my code into the original mod.
