Are you sick and tired of placing carpets on fences? Me too! No longer shall our immersion be torn asunder!

This mod adds new fence blocks (called stiles) that function identically to carpeted fences. Players can jump over stiles, whilst mobs cannot!

Fully integrates with both vanilla AND supported modded fences (mod support listed below).

### Note
This is a fork of the original [Stylish Stiles](https://modrinth.com/mod/stylish-stiles) made by [Chrisdw889](https://modrinth.com/user/Chrisdw889). He has been inactive on Github over 8 months as of writing this, so I made this fork so that I could use Stylish Stiles in the newer versions of Minecraft. It is 100% compatible with the original mod. I include a version of the original mod for 1.21-1.21.1 so I can add support in the future for modded fences, and because the original mod does not specify 1.21.1 support on Modrinth. If you are transitioning from the old mod to the new mod, all you need to do is delete the old one and download this one. All of your blocks will stay. This mod DOES use some code from the original mod, as is allowed by the MIT license it is under. The original license can be found on this mod's Github page, linked HERE. On a related note, if the original author ever returns to development, I have every intention of attempting to work with them to merge my code into the original mod.
